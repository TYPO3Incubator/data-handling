# Data Handling with Event Sourcing

This package adjusts the data handling components of TYPO3 CMS to utilize
event sourcing, based on https://github.com/TYPO3Incubator/event_sourcing.

## Warning

This implementation is a proof-of-concept prototype and thus experimental
development. Since not all domain events are implemented, this extension
should not be used for production sites.
